        <h1>Important Notice</h1>
        <p>Dear zware customers,</p>

        <p>We regret to inform you that due to a recent <span class="highlight">Cease and Desist</span> order from Epic Games, we have been forced to take down all of our Fortnite cheats and related products. This action is beyond our control and was a direct result of legal action taken by Epic Games to protect their intellectual property.</p>

        <div class="notice">
            <p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>
            <p>All current services related to Fortnite cheats have been permanently discontinued. You will no longer be able to access, purchase, or use these products.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We understand that this may be disappointing news for many of you, but it's important to recognize the risks involved with the creation and distribution of cheat software. Epic Games has been particularly aggressive in enforcing their policies, and we must comply with their legal demands.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to our support team at <a href="mailto:zasodev@gmail.com">zasodev@gmail.com</a>. We are doing our best to handle this situation smoothly for all our customers.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your understanding and support.</p>
